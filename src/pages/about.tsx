            Hi!
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Welcome to <Title as="span" text="Oh, that bridge!" />, the page
            which aims to gather bridges from all around the world.
            <br />
            I'm very happy you've stopped by <Title as="span" text=":)" />
            <br />
            <br />
            This is actually the 2nd version of{" "}
            <Title as="span" text="Oh, that bridge!" />, but the reason to build
            it hasn't changed - to learn new things, to improve code, to write
            better and cleaner. The first version has been released in March
            2018. It focused on pictures presentation and bridges locations (it
            has a Google map with markers implemented). I've created it because
            I wanted to better understand how React hooks work and how can you
            use them in GraphQL queries. It was also my first application with a
            public domain <Title as="span" text=":)" />
            <br />
            <br />
            In this <Title as="span" text="2.0" /> release I wanted to focus on
            several things:
            <br />
            - Animations and overall reception,
            <br />
            - User experience (I wanted to make it scroll-less, but after a
            while I resigned),
            <br />
            - Simple and fast search mechanism
            <br />
            - Simpler maintenance
            <br />
            - Server side rendering
            <br />
            - SEO optimisation
            <br />
            - Improve my designing skills
            <br />
            <br />I hope you have noticed at least one of these things{" "}
            <Title as="span" text=":)" />
            <br />
            <br />
            I have already mentioned some technologies, so mabye let's take a
            deeper look into the tech-stack:
            <br />
            - <Title as="span" text="React" /> with{" "}
            <Title as="span" text="TypeScript" /> - I've been using TypeScript
            for a year now and I don't beleve I would ever go back. The project
            is not complex, so I did not have to define many types, but anyway,
            it makes me feel comfortable.
            <br />
            - <Title as="span" text="NextJS" /> - Since I wanted to focus on
            SEO, NextJS was a natural choice. It turned out to be super
            programmer-friendly and also provides lots of optimization tools. So
            I did not have to care about the image optimization in order to keep
            the performance on a high level.
            <br />
            - <Title as="span" text="Firebase" /> with{" "}
            <Title as="span" text="Firestore" /> - Firebase is a great solution
            since all I have to do is to handle the requests in the NextJS API.
            In case I go for version 3.0, I'll already have the data{" "}
            <Title as="span" text=":)" />
            <br />
            - <Title as="span" text="Algolia" /> - this wasn't planned, but I
            realized it would be good to make a pleasant and friendly search.
            Since algolia is recommended (by firebase) search and discover
            platform I decided to give it a shot. I'm very happy with the result{" "}
            <Title as="span" text=":)" /> (but also, I only perform a simple
            search)
            <br />
            - <Title as="span" text="Framer Motion" /> with{" "}
            <Title as="span" text="React Intersection Observer" /> - at the
            beginning of 2021 I've seen my first video with Framer Motion. It
            seemed so simple and so powerfull and I had to try it. I am not
            really sure yet what's the best way to build components using it,
            but maybe after a few weeks or months I'll squeeze it somewhere in a
            project structure. React Intersection Observer works with Framer
            Motion out of the box! So you can acheive estonishing (or simply -
            nice) results with just a few lines of code. This is actually
            something I'm going to certainly remember from this project.
            <br />
            - <Title as="span" text="Atomic CSS" /> with{" "}
            <Title as="span" text="Styled components" />- huge credit to my work
            colleagues, who introduced it to me. It makes to project structure
            much cleaner and since I'm using styled-components I cannot think of
            a better pair.
            <br />
            <br />
            The entire code base, is available here:{" "}

            Hope you will find your bridges here!
